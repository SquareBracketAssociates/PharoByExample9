I'm expert in language design and reengineering. I worked on traits. Traits have been introduced in Pharo, Perl, PHP and under a variant into Scala, Groovy and Fortress. I'm expert on software quality, program understanding, program visualisations, reengineering and metamodeling. I'm one of the father of Moose, an open-source software analysis platform http://www.moosetechnology.org/ and https://modularmoose.org. I created Synectique a company building dedicated tools for advanced software analyses. I'm one of creator and the leader of Pharo http://www.pharo.org/ a dynamic reflective object-oriented language supporting live programming. Since 2013, I built the industrial Pharo consortium http://consortium.pharo.org and I lead the consortium engineering team.
Our objective is to deliver a highly robust, versatile, compact and productive environment to develop and deploy advanced applications.
I work regularly with companies (Thales, Wordline, Siemens, Berger-Levrault, Arolla,...) on software evolution problems. I wrote couple hundred articles and several books. I'm editor of two book collections available at: http://books.pharo.org.
