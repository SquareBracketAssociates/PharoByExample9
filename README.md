# Pharo by Example 90' repository is now at https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/NewPharoByExample9/

Why? Because the history looks corrupted and we could not push anymore, even after clean clone. 
I do not have the expertise to understand why and how to fix this.
So to be able to work and test we created a (temporary) new repository

This one should be read only. 

# PharoByExample90
A new version of Pharo by example for Pharo. You can find the automatic build at 
https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/PharoByExample9/releases/download/latest/PBE9-wip.pdf
